### Key Performance Improvements
- **Code Splitting**: Non-critical pages are loaded on-demand
- **Vendor Separation**: React and animation libraries cached separately
- **Tree Shaking**: AI vendor completely tree-shaken (unused code eliminated)
- **Gzip Compression**: Effective compression ratios across all chunks
- **Progressive Loading**: Users only download what they need
